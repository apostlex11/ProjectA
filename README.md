# ProjectA
## First Website Creation

My motivation was to actively build a website from scratch for the first time, encounter some bugs and experience debugging as I create a platform. I built this project to get a first hand learning experience, and make something with the coding skills I've obtained until now. I had few bugs I've ran into and fixed it with little to no struggle with extended research. My project is a website that assists new Bootcamp students to have a place where they can jot down notes and have access anywhere, anytime. I've learned that through trail and error it only gets easier through experience and just trying new methods out instead of just sitting and thinking about a solution.
